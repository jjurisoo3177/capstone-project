                <h2>What is ExpandingCraft?</h2>
                <p>Welcome, wanderers! ExpandingCraft is a friendly survival Minecraft server.<br>
                    Originally we started out with a small world border of 4x4 chunks. This has
                    been steadily expanding over the last year. We have seen many players, done
                    number of community projects and created the lore for our server. We hope you
                    have a wonderful stay, if you decide to play with us!
                </p>

                <h2>Playing on Expandingcraft</h2>
                <p>We support most playing styles! Most of our players like to hop
                    on here and there, and enjoy making their own builds. We also have some community
                    areas and resources near the spawn. However disruptive gameplay is not supported.<br>
                    Over time the server has accumulated quite a number of builds, some made by cooperation,
                    many by individual players. If you like a relaxing building experience, you are more than welcome!
